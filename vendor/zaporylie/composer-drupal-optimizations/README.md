# About

This composer-plugin contains a set of improvements that makes running heavy duty composer commands (i.e. `composer update` or `composer require`) much faster.

### Composer 2
Since Composer 2 is quite fast by default, this plugin is not needed, and will be disabled if Composer 2 is detected. If everyone involved in development of a project is using Composer 2, this plugin becomes redundant and can be removed from the list of project dependencies.

# Installation

```bash
composer require zaporylie/composer-drupal-optimizations:^1.1 --dev
```

No configuration required ðŸŽŠ

# Optimizations

- Reduce memory usage and CPU usage by removing legacy symfony tags

# Benchmark

Following numbers are for clean https://github.com/drupal-composer/drupal-project/ without and with this plugin.

Before:

```
Memory usage: 323.19MB (peak: 1121.09MB), time: 13.68s
```

After:

```
Memory usage: 238.66MB (peak: 297.17MB), time: 4.84s
```

> php 7.2, macOS High Sierra, i7, 16GB RAM

# Configuration

If no configuration is provided this package will provide sensible defaults based on the `drupal/core` version constraint in the root composer.json
file. Default configuration should cover 99% of the cases. However, in case you want to manually specify the tags
that should be filtered out you are welcome to use the `extra` section:

```json
{
  "extra": {
    "composer-drupal-optimizations": {
      "require": {
        "symfony/symfony": ">3.4"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

***Recommendation note:***
Use defaults (skip config above) if possible - this package will be maintained throughout the Drupal's lifecycle in order
to optimize legacy constraints in parallel with Drupal's requirements.

All you have to do is to make sure your drupal core constraint in the root composer.json is set to `drupal/core: ^8.5` or above. If you use a Drupal distribution, be sure to explicitly require `drupal/core` in your own project as well.
