# SF Gov Form.io

This module stores the library definitions, and related code for Form.io forms.

## Todo

- [ ] Remove the ability to choose a version for Form.io and Form.io SFDS packages from the UI. This requires testing existing forms first.
- [ ] Complete and document locally hosted config option, or remove it.
