<p><strong>{{ campaign_name }} will expire on <em>{{ campaign_expiration_date }}</em></strong></p>

<p>When the campaign expires, the campaign will save as a draft and San Franciscans won’t be able to see the page.</p>

<p>If your campaign is over, you don’t need to do anything.</p>

<p>If your campaign is still running, <a href="https://sfgov.org/user">go to SF.gov and reset the expiry date</a>. You can reset the date for up to a year in the future.</p>

<p>If you are not actively editing and marketing your campaign, you should archive it. San Franciscans won’t trust out-of-date information.</p>

<p>If you can’t edit on SF.gov yourself, <a href="https://airtable.com/shrejrsBqjhZKtRCR">request an edit to a page on SF.gov</a>.</p>
