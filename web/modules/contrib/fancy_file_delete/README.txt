FANCY FILE DELETE

What this module can do:

1. View of all managed files with an option to force delete them via VBO custom actions
2. Manually deleting managed files by FID (and an option to force the delete if you really want to).
3. Deleting unused files from the default files directory that are not in the file managed table. AKA deleting all the unmanaged files.
4. Deleting unused files from the whole install that are no longer attached to nodes & the file usage table. AKA deleting all the orphaned files.
