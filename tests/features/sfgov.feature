Feature: Sfgov Content
  In order to test some basic Behat functionality
  As a website user
  I need to be able to see that the Drupal and Drush drivers are working

@api @sfgov
Scenario: Create department node
  Given "department" content:
  | title           |
  | Test Department |
  When I go to "departments/test-department"
  Then I should see "Test Department"

@api @sfgov
Scenario: Create topic and transaction related to that topic
Given I am logged in as a user with the "administrator" role
When I go to "node/add/topic"
Then I enter "Test Topic" for "Title"
And I enter "published" for "moderation_state[0][state]"
And I press "Save"
When I go to "topics/test-topic"
Then I should see "Test Topic"
When I go to "node/add/transaction"
Then I enter "Test Transaction" for "Title"
And I enter "http://external-url.org" for "field_direct_external_url[0][uri]"
And I enter "Test Topic" for "field_topics[0][target_id]"
And I enter "published" for "moderation_state[0][state]"
And I press "Save"
# Given I have run the drush command "cr"
When I go to "topics/test-topic"
Then I should see "Test Topic"
And I should see "Test Transaction"
When I click "Test Transaction"
Then I should see "Test Transaction"
Given I am not logged in
When I go to "topics/test-topic"
Then I should see "Test Topic"
And I should see "Test Transaction"
And I should see a ".title-url" element
And the ".title-url" element should have the attribute "target" equal to "_blank"
