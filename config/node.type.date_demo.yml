help: "Here are the viable different field types for displaying date information. Each group is a different field type, and then within that group is several different ways of displaying that data. \r\n* If you want to see the options on the individual fields, go to /admin/structure/types/manage/date_demo/fields and click the field type.\r\n* For further display options go to /admin/structure/types/manage/date_demo/form-display and change the widget. \r\n* Feel free to make and save whatever changes you want on this content type, its very easy to revert.\r\n* If you save a node you can see how they're displayed by default on the frontend\r\n* Saving a node will also tell you which fields are required "
