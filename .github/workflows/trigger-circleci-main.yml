# circleci is the primary ci tool for sfgov, but it is currently set to build on pr's only (with develop being the default branch)
# because of this, main never gets built and so never gets deployed.
# currently, circleci does not have an "allow-list" feature to build only pr's in addition to specific branches.
# see https://discuss.circleci.com/t/allow-branch-whitelist-to-override-only-build-pull-requests/6392
# and https://ideas.circleci.com/cloud-feature-requests/p/allow-branch-whitelist-to-override-only-build-pull-requests
